# [637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/average-of-levels-in-binary-tree/)

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Output: `[3, 14.5, 11]`

Explanation: The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return `[3, 14.5, 11]`.
